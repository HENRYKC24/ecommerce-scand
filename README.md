# E-Commerce-website
This is an e-commerce website where users can buy different categories of food. You can add items to cart and know the total amount of money for all the items in the cart before checking out. It fetches data from a graphQL API.

## Interesting Features
- When an item is of different sizes, colors, etc, you can add the same product with a different attribute as a different product in the cart.
- You can remove an Item from the cart.
- When you choose a combination of attributes for a particular product and that product with the same combination of chosen attribute is in the cart, the 'Add To Cart' button changes to 'Remove Item' if it is only one or 'Remove Items' it more than one. Immediately, you will be presented with increase and decrease buttons as well.
- Items that are out of stock can not be added to the cart.
- The total money payable changes as you change the quantities in the mini cart pop up, which shows when you click the cart icon at the top right corner of the navigation bar.
- You can switch the currencies.
- When you close the app, your cart data persists.

## Getting Started

- Click on the `Code` green drop down button then COPY.
- In your local PC, open your terminal in the folder you would like to clone the repository into
- Clone the repository with the command: `git clone (copied link)`; like so: `git clone https://github.com/HENRYKC24/ecommerce-scand.git`
- After the clone, type in the command `cd ecommerce-scand` to access the app directory on the terminal
- Run `npm install` to get all the project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the dev-server.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Tests
- Run `npm test`.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
